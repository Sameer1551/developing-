# AI Health Prediction Alert Integration

## Overview

The AI Health Prediction system now includes integrated alert functionality that allows administrators to quickly issue alerts based on AI predictions. When the AI system detects potential health risks, administrators can immediately create and send alerts to health workers and administrators in the affected districts.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– **AI Prediction Integration**
- **Smart Prefilling**: Alert form automatically populated with prediction data
- **Risk-Based Priority**: Priority levels automatically set based on AI risk assessment
- **Contextual Information**: Prediction details included in alert notes
- **Targeted Distribution**: Alerts sent to relevant districts automatically

### ðŸš¨ **Seamless Alert Creation**
- **One-Click Alert**: "Issue Alert" button directly from prediction cards
- **Pre-filled Data**: No need to manually enter prediction information
- **SMS Notifications**: Automatic SMS sending to health workers
- **Success Feedback**: Real-time confirmation when alert is issued

### ðŸ“Š **Intelligent Data Mapping**
- **Disease Type Mapping**: Automatically categorizes as "Disease Outbreak"
- **Priority Mapping**: 
  - High Risk â†’ Critical Priority
  - Medium Risk â†’ High Priority  
  - Low Risk â†’ Medium Priority
- **District Targeting**: Sends to specific district from prediction
- **Team Assignment**: Automatically assigns to "Medical Response Team"

## How It Works

### 1. **AI Prediction Display**
The system shows AI predictions with:
- Disease type and risk level
- Affected district
- Probability percentage
- Timeframe for potential outbreak
- Contributing factors

### 2. **Issue Alert Process**
1. **Click "Issue Alert"** on any prediction card
2. **Modal Opens** with pre-filled data from prediction
3. **Review Information** - all fields populated automatically
4. **Modify if Needed** - edit any pre-filled information
5. **Submit Alert** - sends SMS notifications immediately

### 3. **Automatic Data Population**
The alert form is automatically populated with:
```
Title: "Predicted [Disease] Outbreak"
Description: "AI prediction indicates a [risk] risk of [disease] outbreak in [district] district within [timeframe]. Contributing factors: [factors]."
Type: "Disease Outbreak"
Priority: [Mapped from risk level]
District: [From prediction]
Location: "[District] District"
Assigned To: "Medical Response Team"
Notes: "AI Prediction Details:
- Probability: [X%]
- Timeframe: [X days/weeks]
- Risk Level: [High/Medium/Low]
- Contributing Factors: [list]"
```

## Technical Implementation

### **Component Integration**
- `PredictionsTab.tsx`: Main prediction display with alert buttons
- `CreateAlertModal.tsx`: Enhanced to accept prefill data
- `smsService.ts`: SMS notification system
- `AlertManagementTab.tsx`: Alert listing and management

### **Data Flow**
1. **AI Prediction** â†’ Displayed in prediction cards
2. **User Action** â†’ Click "Issue Alert" button
3. **Data Mapping** â†’ Prediction data mapped to alert format
4. **Modal Prefill** â†’ Form populated with mapped data
5. **User Review** â†’ Option to modify pre-filled data
6. **Alert Creation** â†’ Alert created and SMS sent
7. **Success Feedback** â†’ Confirmation notification shown

### **Risk Level Mapping**
```typescript
const priorityMapping = {
  'High': 'Critical',
  'Medium': 'High', 
  'Low': 'Medium'
};
```

## User Experience

### **Visual Design**
- **Alert Icon**: AlertTriangle icon added to "Issue Alert" button
- **Success Notification**: Green success message with checkmark
- **Modal Title**: Changes to "Issue Alert from AI Prediction"
- **Button Text**: Changes to "Issue Alert" instead of "Create Alert"

### **Workflow**
1. **View Predictions**: See AI predictions in cards
2. **Assess Risk**: Review risk level and probability
3. **Issue Alert**: Click button to create alert
4. **Review Data**: Check pre-filled information
5. **Send Alert**: Submit to send notifications
6. **Confirmation**: See success message

## Benefits

### **Efficiency**
- **Time Saving**: No manual data entry required
- **Accuracy**: AI data directly transferred to alert
- **Consistency**: Standardized alert format
- **Speed**: Quick response to potential threats

### **Intelligence**
- **Context Awareness**: Alerts include AI prediction context
- **Risk Assessment**: Priority based on AI risk analysis
- **Targeted Response**: Specific district targeting
- **Team Assignment**: Appropriate team assignment

### **Communication**
- **Immediate Notification**: SMS sent instantly
- **Comprehensive Information**: All prediction details included
- **Professional Format**: Standardized alert message
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of AI-based alerts

## Example Usage

### **Scenario: Cholera Prediction**
1. **AI Prediction**: "High risk of Cholera in Senapati district"
2. **Click "Issue Alert"**: Opens modal with pre-filled data
3. **Pre-filled Alert**:
   - Title: "Predicted Cholera Outbreak"
   - Description: "AI prediction indicates a high risk of cholera outbreak in Senapati district within 7-10 days. Contributing factors: Recent flooding, Poor water quality, Population density."
   - Type: "Disease Outbreak"
   - Priority: "Critical"
   - District: "Senapati"
4. **Submit**: Sends SMS to health workers in Senapati
5. **Success**: Confirmation message appears

## Integration Points

### **With Alert Management**
- Created alerts appear in Alert Management tab
- Full alert history maintained
- SMS delivery tracking available
- Alert status management

### **With SMS System**
- Uses same SMS service as manual alerts
- Same delivery tracking and reporting
- Same recipient filtering logic
- Same message formatting

### **With User Management**
